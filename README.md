## Introduction

By [Yuncheng Jiang*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=v5jDFU8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Zixun Zhang*](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=13FeVFsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Shixi Qin](), [Yao guo](), [Zhen Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0TTt3QsAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

This repo is a PyTorch implementation of ["APAUNet: Axis Projection Attention UNet for Small Target Segmentation in 3D Medical Images"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01485), accepted by ACCV 2022.

APAUNet is a segmentation network for 3D medical image data. It aims to improve the small targe segmentation accuracy using projection 2D attention mechanism on three axes. For more details, please refer to the paper.

The model was trained and test on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon Task 08 (Hepatic Vessels). APAUNet architecture is an architecture that has shown specially good results in segmentation of objects with a small size (like tumors or organs), but it has never been tried before this in a vessel segmentation context. 

The results obtained for vessel segmentation is competitive to the public results of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon. The code was modified to run it in Polyaxon. Each changed performed in the code is explained with a comment and some files (like tester.py) has been added.

## Dataset

### 1. Dataset download

Datasets can be acquired via following links:
* [Medical Segmentation Decathlon: Liver and Pancreas](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HqEgzS8BV2c7xYNrZdEAnrHk7osJJ--2)

### 2. Setting up the datasets

After you have downloaded the datasets, you can follow the settings in * [nnUNet](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Segmentation/nnUNet) for path configurations and preprocessing procedures. Finally, your folders should be organized as follows:

```
./DATASET/
  ├── nnUNet_raw/
      ├── nnUNet_raw_data/
          ├── Task01_Liver/
              ├── imagesTr/
              ├── imagesTs/
              ├── labelsTr/
              ├── labelsTs/
              ├── dataset.json
          ├── Task02_Pancreas/
              ├── imagesTr/
              ├── imagesTs/
              ├── labelsTr/
              ├── labelsTs/
              ├── dataset.json
          ├── Task03_Synapse/
              ├── imagesTr/
              ├── imagesTs/
              ├── labelsTr/
              ├── labelsTs/
              ├── dataset.json
      ├── nnUNet_cropped_data/
  ├── nnUNet_trained_models/
  ├── nnUNet_preprocessed/
```

### 3. Pre-processing

After that, you can preprocess the above data using following commands:
```
nnUNet_convert_decathlon_task -i ../DATASET/nnUNet_raw/nnUNet_raw_data/Task01_Liver
nnUNet_convert_decathlon_task -i ../DATASET/nnUNet_raw/nnUNet_raw_data/Task02_Pancreas
nnUNet_convert_decathlon_task -i ../DATASET/nnUNet_raw/nnUNet_raw_data/Task03_Synapse

nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess -t 1
nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess -t 2
nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess -t 3
```
Then the pre-processed data are stored in separate folders, for example:
```
nnUNet_preprocessed/Task001_Liver/nnUNetData_plans_v2.1_stage0
```

## Usage 

### 0. Config

The code is set to run directly in Polyaxon, so each path is relative to the NAS folder.

All the training and testing hyper-parameters are set in [config.py](config.py). You can modify these configurations according to your requirements.

### 1. Training

```
python train.py 
```
Notice that in order to be used in polyaxon, a polyaxonfile has been already prepared:

```bash
polyaxon run -p <project_name> -f polyaxonfile.yaml
```

### 2. Testing

```
python tester.py
```
It will produce a predicted segmentation mask for the given testing data.

Notice that in order to be used in polyaxon, a different polyaxonfile has been already prepared:

```bash
polyaxon run -p <project_name> -f polyaxonfileTest.yaml
```
